<p>When you access &eacute;tude Health services, you trust us with your personal information.&nbsp; We highly value that trust.&nbsp; Our commitment to you is our ongoing transparency about the personal information we collect and our efforts to help you to understand our privacy practices.&nbsp; This notice describes the personal information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you can make regarding these data.</p>

<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) describes how we collect, use, disclose and protect your Personal Information (defined below). It applies to all Personal Information processed by us on any of the services provided by &eacute;tude Health health providers, as well as written, electronic, and oral communications.</p>

For clarity, the NPP, not this Privacy Policy, explains our privacy practices with respect to your Protected Health Information (&ldquo;PHI&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Unless we define a term in this Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Policy have the meaning provided in the Clinical Services and Practice Policies Agreement, which you can view via your account profile.

Whenever material changes to this Policy are made, we will provide you with notice before the modifications are effective by sending a message to the email address associated with your account, or by posting a notice to your user account. By continuing to access or use the Services after changes to this Policy become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Policy. If any changes are unacceptable to you, you should stop using &eacute;tude Health health services.</p>

<br />
A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a small data file that certain websites write to your computer or smart device when you visit them. A cookie can&rsquo;t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. We use session cookies that are deleted when you leave our website and close your browser, and persistent cookies that can remain even after you leave. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the website uses to track the pages you&rsquo;ve visited. The cookies that are configured by our website do not contain directly identifying information, such as your name or sensitive information, such as your credit card number.<br />
<br />
Types of Cookies on Our Services. We use the following types of cookies on our Services:<br />
<br />
Strictly Necessary Cookies &ndash; These cookies are essential because they enable you to use our Services. For example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to access secure areas on our Services. Without these cookies, Services cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you for marketing purposes. This category of cookies is essential for our Services to work and they cannot be disabled.</p>

<p>Functional Cookies &ndash; We use functional cookies to remember your choices so we can tailor our Services to provide you with enhanced features and personalized content. For example, these cookies can be used to remember your name and location or some elements of your login credentials. We do not use functional cookies to target you with online marketing. While some of these cookies can be disabled, this may result in less functionality during your use of our Services.</p>

<p>Performance or Analytics Cookies &ndash; These cookies collect passive information about how you use our Services, including webpages you visit and links you click. We use the information collected by such cookies to improve and optimize our Services.</p>

Modern browsers also allow you to block third-party cookies, please see section above to learn how to do that.<br />
<br />
b. Web Beacons<br />
<br />
Web Beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our website to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track and measure the performance of our website and Services, monitor how many web visitors we have, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user&rsquo;s device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).<br />
<br />
c. Analytics Technologies<br />
<br />
Users of our Services who have JavaScript enabled are tracked using analytics technologies, including Google Analytics and other analytics and/or crash reporting providers.

The data collected by the analytics technology is primarily used to optimize the Service experience for our users. We also use this data for our own business purposes, for example, to analyze how many users we have, where visitors come from, and understand how they interact with us.<br />
<br />
d. Interest-Based Advertising<br />
<br />
We may use information collected about a user&rsquo;s use of our Services to arrange for advertisements about our Services to be served to the user on third party&rsquo;s websites. To do so, our advertising service providers place or recognize a unique cookie on the user&rsquo;s browser and use other techniques, such as pixel tags.<br />
<br />
Users may, under some circumstances, opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising. The opt-out may be provided through specific opt-out cookies. Please visit the following: YourAdChoices.com and the Networkadvertising.org to learn more.<br />
<br />
e. Mobile Applications<br />
<br />
Depending on your permissions, we may receive your Personal Information from your internet service and mobile device providers. Users of mobile devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising may opt-out in several ways. Learn more about your choices for mobile devices by visiting Your Ad Choices (see above).

Your account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of the Internet, and cannot ensure the security of the information that is transmitted through the Internet.<br />
<br />
Please recognize that protecting your Personal Information is also your responsibility. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your information when you are on the Internet, or when you communicate with us and with others through the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

We currently may not respond to web browser &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals or other mechanisms that may allow you to opt out of the collection of information across networks of websites and online services as there is no standard for how online services should respond to such signals.

<br />
b. Children and Privacy<br />
<br />
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children in connection with the use of our Services. This Section explains our online information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to information collection from children under the age of 13 (&ldquo;child&rdquo; or &ldquo;children&rdquo;) in accordance with the U.S. Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&ldquo;COPPA&rdquo;). For more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children&rsquo;s online privacy, please go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule</a>.<br />
<br />
Our Services include online services that may be used to facilitate health care for a child. A parent or guardian can create a &eacute;tude Health account on behalf of a dependent child and attest that they have legal authority to do so. Children under the age of 18 are not eligible at this time to register directly for an account. If your child directly uses your &eacute;tude Health account, either with or without your permission, we may collect information directly from the child. If you prefer for your child to not directly interact with &eacute;tude Health online, please do not provide account credentials to your child. Please note certain state patient privacy laws may permit a child to directly obtain certain types of health care services independent of their parent or guardian.<br />
<br />
For registration, children cannot directly register for our Services. During the user registration process, the parent or guardian can create a children&rsquo;s account by providing certain information about the child, including name, birth date, address, and login credentials.<br />
<br />
Consent: During account registration for a child, parents or guardians are asked to review and consent to our COPPA Parental Consent form. If a parent or guardian chooses not to consent to the collection and use of their child&rsquo;s information, they may not create an online account for the child. At any time, a parent and guardian may revoke their consent. Once consent is revoked, a child may not use any Services online, unless a new consent is signed.<br />
<br />
The above sections of this Policy contains details about the information we collect, which extend to information we collect about children. The information we collect will be used for the purposes described above.<br />
<br />
No personal information about a child will be made available to the public or sold. We may share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform business, professional, or technology services for us, always in accordance with all applicable laws including HIPAA.<br />
<br />
In addition to your right to revoke your consent for the collection of your child&rsquo;s personal information, you may request to review the personal information we have collected from your child. Please submit your request or any questions to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@etude.health">privacy@etude.health</a>.<br />
<br />

<br />
We may contain links to other sites that are owned or operated by third parties. We are not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices of any third parties. To protect your information, we encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those third parties.<br />
<br />
d. Our Social Media Usage<br />
<br />
We have accounts on social media platforms through which we may post information or conduct promotional activities. If you use social media to follow us or interact with us, we may collect Personal Information you choose to share with us. Please understand your use of the social media services may result in the collection or sharing of information about you by those social media services. We have no control over, and decline all responsibility for, the use of your personal data by these third parties. Your use of social media, including your interactions with us on social media, are at your discretion. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media services with which you interact to make sure you understand how your information may be collected, used, and shared by those social media services.<br />
<br />
e. International Transfer<br />
<br />
Your information may be stored on controlled servers with limited access and may be stored and processed in the United States or another country where our service providers or backup service providers are located. We offer our Services only to individuals located in the United States, and we do not advertise our Services outside the United States. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide your Personal Information to us, please note that we may transfer your Personal Information to the United States or another country where our service providers are located, and such countries may not provide the same data protection. Those who choose to access and use the Services from outside the United States do so on their own initiative, at their own risk, with this understanding.</p>

<p>b. Accessing, deleting, and opting-out of the sale of your information</p>

<p>The following are the rights provided to California residents under the CCPA.</p>

<p>i. The right to access information</p>

<p>&eacute;tude Health, upon receipt of a verifiable request, will provide the requestor the pieces of information that it holds about the individual. If &eacute;tude Health cannot verify the individual, &eacute;tude Health will provide the requestor a list of categories of the pieces of information &eacute;tude Health has collected about the individual.</p>

<p>ii. The right to delete information</p>

<p>&eacute;tude Health, upon receipt of a verifiable request, will delete the information it holds about the individual unless an exception under the CCPA applies or the information is otherwise subject to HIPAA, in which case HIPAA will preempt CCPA.</p>

<p>iii. The right to opt out of the sale of information</p>

<p>An individual may request that &eacute;tude Health not sell information about the user</p>

<p>NOTE: Under CCPA, the definition of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; is very broad. &eacute;tude Health does not sell personal information for financial gain. However, by using third party services, some information sharing might be considered a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under the CCPA.&nbsp; The definition of &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under CCPA includes &ldquo;selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer&rsquo;s personal information by the business to another business or third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To exercise these CCPA rights, you may visit us at &eacute;tude Healthhealth.com/privacy.&nbsp; For requests of access and deletion, &eacute;tude Health will use the information you provide in your request to verify your identity and to identify the presence of the requestor in our systems. Information required for a request to access or delete personal information includes: Name, date of birth, email address, phone number, and address.&nbsp; You may elect to designate an authorized agent to make this request. For more information on authorized agents under the CCPA, please visit the California Attorney General&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>We will honor any legal right you may have to access such information, but fees, if permitted by law, may apply.</p>

<h2>Revisions</h2>

<p>As state and federal laws change, and as we add new features to our Sites, &eacute;tude Health may periodically revise this Policy. We will post changes to this policy on our website or applications. Your continued use of our Sites and mobile applications following the posting of changes will mean you accept those changes.</p>
