<h1 style="text-align: center;">&eacute;tude Health, Inc.&nbsp;Notice of Privacy Practices For Protected Health Information</h1>

<h2>Effective date February 9, 2021.</h2>

<p>This Notice of Privacy Practices (the &ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) describes how &eacute;tude Health&nbsp;and all members of its Affiliated Covered Entity (collectively, &ldquo;&eacute;tude Health&rdquo; &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) may use and disclose your protected health information to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations and for other purposes that are permitted or required by law. An Affiliated Covered Entity is a group of health care providers under common ownership or control that designates itself as a single entity for purposes of compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;). The members of the &eacute;tude Health&nbsp;Affiliated Covered Entity will share protected health information with each other for the treatment, payment, and health care operations of the &eacute;tude Health&nbsp;Affiliated Covered Entity and as permitted by HIPAA and this Notice of Privacy Practices. For a complete list of the members of the &eacute;tude Health&nbsp;Affiliated Covered Entity, please contact the &eacute;tude Health&nbsp;Privacy Office. Please revise this notice carefully.</p>

<p>The protection of your health information is very important. We recognize that many of the things we discuss are sensitive, and because of this, it is important that you are aware of how this information is used and may be revealed. This document contains a description about how your protected health information is used and sometimes disclosed. As a provider of service covered under the federal &ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo; law we are required to give you this notice and to abide by its terms. (We reserve the right to change the terms of this notice, and if that happens we will provide you with an updated copy with the changes.)</p>

<p>In general, the communications between a patient and provider are confidential and protected by law and we can only release your protected health information with your permission, or under certain circumstances. This document and the other intake documents you received discuss those circumstances. When we make a disclosure, we will always try to limit the information that we reveal. In general, we will try to disclose only the amount necessary.</p>

<h2>Uses and Disclosures:</h2>

<p>We can disclose information for the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations. An example of a disclosure for treatment purposes is one where we discuss your treatment/evaluation with your general physician to coordinate our services. An example of a disclosure for payment is where we discuss your case with your health insurance carrier to determine if you are eligible for coverage. An example of a disclosure for health care operations is where we disclose information for the purposes of conducting quality assessment and quality improvement functions. We can also disclose information for the purposes of facilitating your care via our relationships with vendors and business associates that support our work with you, in which case the privacy of these disclosures are protected under the business associate agreements that we have in place with these vendors and associates. Certain aspects and components of our services are performed through contracts with outside persons or organizations, such as administrative services, billing, auditing, accreditation, outcomes data collection, legal services, scheduling, etc. We may disclose your information to these business associates who assist us with our health care operations. In all cases, we require these associates to appropriately safeguard the privacy of your information. An example of a disclosure for the purposes of facilitating your care is the disclosure of information to an automated appointment scheduling service for the scheduling and coordination of your appointments, such as if one of our coaches contacts you via text messaging or via phone. Another example of a disclosure for the purposes of facilitating your care is the utilization of a third-party messaging service to transmit encrypted messages between you and your clinician.</p>

<p>We can also make disclosures without your consent under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In some legal proceedings we may be required to disclose disclose disclose information about you without your consent. We will try to maintain the confidentiality of your protected health information, but if we receive a lawful order from a court or administrative authority, a valid subpoena, search warrant, or coroner&rsquo;s inquest we may have to disclose information.</li>
	<li>If we believe you or an identified patient pose a serious risk of harm to yourself or someone else, or if the welfare of a child is in jeopardy, we are required to take protective actions. This may mean that we have to contact a potential victim, the police, child and family services, government authorities whose job it is to protect the elderly or dependent adults, or other parties to minimize the risk of harm.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we make disclosures for these purposes, we will disclose only the information necessary. Any additional disclosures will be made only with your written authorization and you can revoke that authorization at any time.</p>

<p>We are permitted to contact you to remind you about appointments, to discuss treatment alternatives, or other health-related services that may be of interest to you.</p>
