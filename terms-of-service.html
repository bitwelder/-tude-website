<h2>Exclusive Remedy</h2>

<p>If you are dissatisfied with the Services, your sole and exclusive remedy is to stop using the Services and cancel your account (if applicable).</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

<p>a. Agreement to Arbitrate</p>

<p>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services (collectively, &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an &ldquo;IP Protection Action&rdquo;). You will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide us with written notice to opt out of arbitration (&ldquo;Arbitration Opt-out Notice&rdquo;) by email at legal@etude.health&nbsp;or by regular mail to our mailing address at: 175 Forest Ave. Palo Alto, CA 94301 within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms, or if you have not registered for an account, then within thirty (30) days following the date you first use our Services. If you don&rsquo;t provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless you otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any limitations set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate on the right to arbitrate claims on a class or representative basis, or as part of a consolidated proceeding, as to a given claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in Delaware. All other claims will be arbitrated. This &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

<p>Arbitration Rules.</p>

<p>The arbitration will be administered by the&nbsp;<em>American Arbitration Association</em>(&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in effect, except as modified by this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section. (The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules">https://www.adr.org/Rules</a>&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>

<p>b. Arbitration Process</p>

<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. AAA provides a general form for a Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for Demand for Arbitration for California residents. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&rsquo;s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

<p>c. Arbitration Location and Procedure</p>

<p>Unless you agree with us otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that are submitted to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

<p>d. Arbitrator&rsquo;s Decision</p>

<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo; section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek, and hereby waive all rights we may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration.</p>

<p>e. Fees</p>

<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

<p>f. Changes</p>

<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, if we change this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section after the date you accepted these Terms or access our Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:legal@etude.health">legal@etude.health</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo; listed at the beginning of these Terms or in the date of our email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and us in accordance with the provisions of this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section as of the date you accepted these Terms, or accessed our Services.</p>

<p>Links to Third Party Websites</p>

<p>The Services may contain links to other sites that are owned and operated by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy and services practices or the content, advertising, products, services or other materials made available on or through any such linked sites. We provide these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement of any kind by us.</p>

<p>General Provisions</p>

<p>These Terms make up the entire agreement relating to your use of the Services, and supersede all prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof.</p>

<p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any of the Services at any time. We will try to give you prior notice of any material changes to the Services. We will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent. &eacute;tude Health and/or our Designated Affiliates may assign our rights in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</p>

<p>We appreciate your feedback, suggestions, and other communications (collectively, &ldquo;Feedback&rdquo;) about the Services. You should know that we can, but are not obligated to, use your Feedback without restriction or any obligation to compensate you, and aside from the laws governing the confidentiality of healthcare information, we have no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>

<p>Even after termination, these Terms will remain in effect such that all terms that by their nature may survive termination will be deemed to survive such termination. In order to protect the integrity of the Services, we may, at any time in our sole discretion, block users from certain IP addresses from accessing the Services. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:legal@etude.health">legal@etude.health</a></p>
